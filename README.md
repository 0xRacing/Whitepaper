## High Level
With Ethereum (Ether) seeking to be the money of the internet, the union of Ethereum and eSports (topically Simulator racing) is inevitable. While existing eSports offer new opportunities for reach and brand exposure, we see online sim racing with the like of iRacing, Assetto Corsa, F1 2020, and countless other as offering unique opportunities that can parallel their real life counterparts. A brand can use existing platforms such as Twitch, Youtube, and other social platforms for eSports / gaming reach, but online racing with in-game / in-sim branding exposure offers an all new brand experience. 

For 2020, [Coca-Cola has announced a multiyear deal to headline sponsor](https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/02/05/enascar-iracing-competition-refreshed-by-coca-cola-beginning-in-2020/) the [eNASCAR iRacing Series](https://www.iracing.com/enascar-coca-cola-iracing-series/) which now includes a $300k prize pool. Multiple [sanctioned NASCAR teams run and support drivers](https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/12/19/2020-enascar-iracing-world-championship-series-teams-drivers/) in this series, with official broadcast coverage from NBC. This shows a growing interest to bridge the gaps in racing, and deliver new opportunities of reach and awareness. 

Countless professional race car drivers from multiple series have publicly stated their use of iRacing as a core component of their training programs. This includes the likes of Dale Earnhardt Jr (NASCAR), Lando Norris (F1), Max Verstappen (F1), Sage Karam (Indycar), Stoffel Vandoorne (Formula E), and Tony Stewart (NASCAR).

Within the current eSports ecosystem, [100 Thieves](https://100thieves.com/) has shown the power in bringing branding, content creators, eSports, and community engagement. With a heavy emphasis on empowering creators, [exclusive merch drops](https://100thieves.com/blogs/lookbooks/numbers-collection), and recent launch of their 100 Thieves Cash App compound with headline sponsor of their HQ building, select partnerships for eSports team rooms, and more. Showing the growing opportunities in the eSports vertical.

*03/14/2020*

With recent unfortunate global events driven by coronavirus, nearly every sport / motorsport has become indefinitely delayed. Though there has been a massive uptick in professional drivers and sanctioning bodies looking to use digial sim racing as an alternate means of racing during this global crisis. 

Every action and purpose needs to be economically driven, so we see this DAO structure as a new means of helping us stay connected globally while continuing to (digitally) enjoy the sports we once did. The 0xRacing team has been seeking out charitable organizations to help drive awareness of leveraging our means of sim racing. We've recently made some request for helping in seeking out and possibly organizing a DAO to coordinate ethereum based donations to support charities providing assitance and resources as we globally combat coronavirus. https://twitter.com/0xRacing/status/1238961132334985216

Over the prior weekend, countless professional drivers across various racing leagues joined the digital eSports world competing in alternative races to their postponed / canceled real life counterparts. 

Some of larger note: 

- Lando Norris (McLaren F1) live streamed on Twitch with over 70k live viewers https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/lando-norris-twitch-record-f1-cancels-aus-grand-prix-1341664 

- Max Verstappen (Red Bull Racing F1) https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/formula1/esports-f1-we-are-the-race-max-verstappen-lando-norris-verloce-coronavirus-a9404016.html

- Dale Earnhardt Jr (Retired NASCAR Cup, Xfinity Team Owner : JR Motorsports) https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2020/03/15/dale-jr-william-byron-josh-williams-nascar-iracing-atlant-motor-speedway-race/

### Tokenized Sponsorships + Collectibles
0xRacing will leverage the ERC-721 token standard to issue and manage sponsorship opportunities. Each token will hold unique value for use during its given application. This will be redeemable to the 0xRacing team for use of sponsorship opportunities. Using the ERC-721 standard means instant access and use of marketplaces such as OpenSea.

0xRacing will issue limited edition digital collectibles also using the ERC-721 standard. This helps provide a trustless account of uniqueness for each. These tokens will also be issues for community engagement and growth, such as unlocking functionality within the 0xRacing community and ecosystem.

### Tokenized Merch
Inspired by launched of [Unisocks](https://unisocks.exchange/) and [Saint Fame](https://www.saintfame.com/), 0xRacing will leverage tokenized merchandise in a similar fashion, helping provide a trustless means of account for uniqueness as well as community inclusion on value capture of merchandise sales.

Further research is being conducted into this growing ecosystem, with announcements of [MetaFactory](https://metafactory.ai/) and [ourZORA](https://www.ourzora.com/)

## Objectives
0xRacing will use the DAO standard to organize a digital race team on the Ethereum Blockchain. This will enable full participation, value capture, and governance by members. The 0xRacing DAO will issue tokenized sponsorship opportunities, digital collectibles, tokenized merchandize, and manage team drivers. 

Each driver to join the 0xRacing DAO will have their own DAO, creating a mesh network of DAOs, with equal participation. 

To visualize how the 0xRacing Mesh can work:

![0xRacing DAO](https://github.com/0xRacing/Branding/blob/master/0xracing_dao.png?raw=true)

This structure enables members of the core 0xRacing DAO to govern drivers, token issuance, use of DAO funds, and more. While also enabling the core 0xRacing DAO to participate in each drivers DAO governance. The DAO of DAOs enables flexible branding, allowing the core 0xRacing DAO (team) to generate it's own brand value, while enabling the same for each driver. Driver can this also use their DAO for more localized opportunities such as on Twitch or Youtube, within their own community / fanbase.
