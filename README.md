## High Level
With Ethereum (Ether) seeking to be the money of the internet, the union of Ethereum and eSports (topically Simulator racing) is inevitable. While existing eSports offer new opportunities for reach and brand exposure, we see online sim racing with the like of iRacing, Assetto Corsa, F1 2020, and countless other as offering unique opportunities that can parallel their real life counterparts. A brand can use existing platforms such as Twitch, Youtube, and other social platforms for eSports / gaming reach, but online racing with in-game / in-sim branding exposure offers an all new brand experience. 

For 2020, [Coca-Cola has announced a multiyear deal to headline sponsor](https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/02/05/enascar-iracing-competition-refreshed-by-coca-cola-beginning-in-2020/) the [eNASCAR iRacing Series](https://www.iracing.com/enascar-coca-cola-iracing-series/) which now includes a $300k prize pool. Multiple [sanctioned NASCAR teams run and support drivers](https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/12/19/2020-enascar-iracing-world-championship-series-teams-drivers/) in this series, with official broadcast coverage from NBC. This shows a growing interest to bridge the gaps in racing, and deliver new opportunities of reach and awareness. 

Countless professional race car drivers from multiple series have publicly stated their use of iRacing as a core component of their training programs. This includes the likes of Dale Earnhardt Jr (NASCAR), Lando Norris (F1), Max Verstappen (F1), Sage Karam (Indycar), Stoffel Vandoorne (Formula E), and Tony Stewart (NASCAR).

Within the current eSports ecosystem, [100 Thieves](https://100thieves.com/) has shown the power in bringing branding, content creators, eSports, and community engadgement. With a heavy emphasis on empowering creators, [exclusive merch drops](https://100thieves.com/blogs/lookbooks/numbers-collection), and recent launch of their 100 Thieves Cash App compound with headline sponsor of their HQ building, select partnerships for eSports team rooms, and more. Showing the growing opportunities in the eSports vertical.


## Objectives
0xRacing will use the DAO standard to organize a digital race team on the Ethereum Blockchain. This will enable full participation, value capture, and governance by members. The 0xRacing DAO will issue tokenized sponsorship opportunities, digital collectibles, tokenized merchandize, and manage team drivers. 

Each driver to join the 0xRacing DAO will have their own DAO, creating a mesh network of DAOs, with equal participation. 

To visualize how this will work:

This structure enables members of the core 0xRacing DAO to govern drivers, token issuance, use of DAO funds, and more. While also enabling the core 0xRacing DAO to participate in each drivers DAO governance. The DAO of DAOs enables flexible branding, allowing the core 0xRacing DAO (team) to generate it's own brand value, while enabling the same for each driver. Driver can this also use their DAO for more localized opportunities such as on Twitch or Youtube, within their own community / fanbase.
